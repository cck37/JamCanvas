# JamCanvas
THE BEST Senior Design Project

Getting Started Locally
	
	1. Copy the repository in a folder.  I made a separate Sites folder under my user.  My file path is:

		Sites/JamCanvas

Installing Node.js and npm

	1. Download the appropriate installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
	2. In the command line, run "node -v" to verify that the install worked
	3. run "npm install npm@latest -g" to install the latest npm

	For more information visit http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html

	4. In the parent folder of this project (Sites) run "npm install connect" in the console.
	5. Run "npm install connect serve-static"
	6. Navigate to the project directory and run "node server.js"

	Now in your browser navigate to http://localhost:8080/index.html and JamCanvas should run

Installing Ruby

	1. If you are using Windows, use http://rubyinstaller.org/ to install.  Linux/Unix and Mac users already should have this installed.
	2. In another command line window run "sudo gem install sass" for Mac or Linux and "gem install sass" for Windows.
	3. When finished, run "sass --watch styles".
