# JamCanvas
THE BEST Senior Design Project

Getting Started Locally
	
	1. Copy the repository in a folder.  I made a separate Sites folder under my user.  My file path is:

		Sites/JamCanvas

	2. Download the appropriate installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
	3. In the command line, run "node -v" to verify that the install worked
	4. run "npm install npm@latest -g" to install the latest npm

	For more information visit http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html

	5. In the parent folder of this project (Sites) run "npm install connect" in the console.
	6. Run "npm install connect serve-static"
	7. Navigate to the project directory and run "node server.js"

	Now in your browser navigate to http://localhost:8080/index.html and JamCanvas should run
